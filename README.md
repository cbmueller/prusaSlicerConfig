# PrusaSlicer Profiles

These profiles are for use in PrusaSlicer. I decided to store this as a backup on github, maybe it will be useful to somone ;)
I'm a total beginner, so please don't use these as some kind of reference.

## Printer Used
My Printer is a Artillery Sidewinder X1, which has not been modified apart from a replaced extruder idler arm and feeder gear.

## Filament Used
I currently use [Extrudr PLA NX2](https://www.extrudr.com/de/produkte/catalogue/?feature=14&material=135).
